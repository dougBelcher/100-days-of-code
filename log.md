# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 23 Dec 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on the HTML section of Free Code Camp.  I did this a year and 1/2 ago but, with not working on it daily, I feel like I need to return/refresh my knowledge.  

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed with all the things I'm taking on right now but if I stick too it and get some help/support, I should be able to work through this successfully.

### Day 2: 24 Dec 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 and the Basic CSS sections.

**Thoughts:** Took a lot longer than I expected but I stuck with it and was able to get through.  The biggest hurdle was just getting started!

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed the Applied Visual Design section in FCC.

**Thoughts:** Worked all day on this and did not get as far as I wanted too.  I guess I kept getting distracted, something about Christmas and holidays of something.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Accessibility section of FCC!

**Thoughts:** Sometimes it is easy to get these done and sometimes it is a distraction.  I'm using my Pomodoro Timer to help me stay focused on the challenges.  It has been taking me all day to get through these sections.

### Day 19: 12 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: A lot of videos on various subjects from Hak5 to Python to Web Scraping.

**Today's Progress**: Primary focus was on viewing an SQL beginner video.  Should finish it up tomorrow.

### Day 22: 17 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Overheard some co-workers talking about containers so I spent my time today on Docker.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to get back to FreeCodeCamp but when I heard them talking about containers I wanted to get a better grounding in what they were talking about.  

### Day 23: 19 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally got back to FreeCodeCamp and ES6 exercises.

**Thoughts:** Got stuck for over an hour on the arrow function and how to string functions together.

### Day 31: 11 Feb 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today was Regular Expressions!

**Thoughts:** Went back to Freecodecamp to do regular expressions, I knew better but couldn't resist.  I am slogging through it and using the idea I get to go back to "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python".

**Today's Progress**: Working on the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python".  Still on the Boring Stuff of Python! :)
