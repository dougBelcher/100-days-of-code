# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 23 Dec 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on the HTML section of Free Code Camp.  I did this a year and 1/2 ago but, with not working on it daily, I feel like I need to return/refresh my knowledge.  

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed with all the things I'm taking on right now but if I stick too it and get some help/support, I should be able to work through this successfully.

### Day 2: 24 Dec 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 and the Basic CSS sections.

**Thoughts:** Took a lot longer than I expected but I stuck with it and was able to get through.  The biggest hurdle was just getting started!

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed the Applied Visual Design section in FCC.

**Thoughts:** Worked all day on this and did not get as far as I wanted too.  I guess I kept getting distracted, something about Christmas and holidays of something.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Accessibility section of FCC!

**Thoughts:** Sometimes it is easy to get these done and sometimes it is a distraction.  I'm using my Pomodoro Timer to help me stay focused on the challenges.  It has been taking me all day to get through these sections.

**Today's Progress**: Spent time watching an SQL for Beginners video on youtube.

<!--- ##### (delete me or comment me out) --->

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of time on misc. subjects from Medium on FreeCodeCamp plus some time on RaspberryPi.

### Day 19: 12 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: A lot of videos on various subjects from Hak5 to Python to Web Scraping.

### Day 20: 15 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Primary focus was on viewing an SQL beginner video.  Should finish it up tomorrow.

### Day 21: 16 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed viewing an SQL beginner video.

**Thoughts:** It was a push to get the SQL video done but I finally made it, now I'm pushing forward getting back to FreeCodeCamp.  

### Day 22: 17 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Overheard some co-workers talking about containers so I spent my time today on Docker.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to get back to FreeCodeCamp but when I heard them talking about containers I wanted to get a better grounding in what they were talking about.  

### Day 23: 19 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally got back to FreeCodeCamp and ES6 exercises.

**Thoughts:** Got stuck for over an hour on the arrow function and how to string functions together.  

### Day 24: 20 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: I fought the entire time with understanding and trying to complete an exercise with Rest parameters.

**Thoughts:** I am feeling so very stupid that I can't get a simple concept like this.

### Day 25: 22 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent an hour and some change on Git on the IBM i, what it is and does.

**Thoughts:** Not sure if I can use this at work but looking for opportunities wherever it can help.
