# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 23 Dec 2018
<!--- ##### (delete me or comment me out) --->

**Today's Progress**: Working on the HTML section of Free Code Camp.  I did this a year and 1/2 ago but, with not working on it daily, I feel like I need to return/refresh my knowledge.  

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed with all the things I'm taking on right now but if I stick too it and get some help/support, I should be able to work through this successfully.
