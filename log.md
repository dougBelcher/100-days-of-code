### Day 1: 23 Dec 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on the HTML section of Free Code Camp.  I did this a year and 1/2 ago but, with not working on it daily, I feel like I need to return/refresh my knowledge.  

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed with all the things I'm taking on right now but if I stick too it and get some help/support, I should be able to work through this successfully.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 and the Basic CSS sections.

**Thoughts:** Took a lot longer than I expected but I stuck with it and was able to get through.  The biggest hurdle was just getting started!

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed the Applied Visual Design section in FCC.

**Thoughts:** Worked all day on this and did not get as far as I wanted too.  I guess I kept getting distracted, something about Christmas and holidays of something.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Accessibility section of FCC!

**Thoughts:** Sometimes it is easy to get these done and sometimes it is a distraction.  I'm using my Pomodoro Timer to help me stay focused on the challenges.  It has been taking me all day to get through these sections.
