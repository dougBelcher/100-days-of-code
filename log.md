**Today's Progress**: Working on the HTML section of Free Code Camp.  I did this a year and 1/2 ago but, with not working on it daily, I feel like I need to return/refresh my knowledge.  

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed with all the things I'm taking on right now but if I stick too it and get some help/support, I should be able to work through this successfully.

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed the Applied Visual Design section in FCC.

**Thoughts:** Worked all day on this and did not get as far as I wanted too.  I guess I kept getting distracted, something about Christmas and holidays of something.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Accessibility section of FCC!

**Thoughts:** Sometimes it is easy to get these done and sometimes it is a distraction.  I'm using my Pomodoro Timer to help me stay focused on the challenges.  It has been taking me all day to get through these sections.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Responsive Web Design Principles of FCC.

**Thoughts:** I had a really hard time getting focused today and used muliple excuses not to do the work.  I did get the section done, however it was a small section.  Looking forward to completing a couple sections tomorrow.
